# ONNX Runtime in Compose Multiplatform Project

Welcome to the **ONNX Runtime in Compose Multiplatform** project! ðŸŽ‰ This repository demonstrates how to integrate the ONNX Runtime with a Kotlin Multiplatform Project using Compose Multiplatform, enabling you to build a cross-platform application to harness the power of machine learning across different platforms (Android and iOS).

## About the Project

In this project, we explore:

- **ONNX Runtime**: A cross-platform, high-performance scoring engine for Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) models.
- **Compose Multiplatform**: A modern UI toolkit for building native user interfaces across multiple platforms using Kotlin.

This project serves as a practical guide for developers looking to combine machine learning capabilities with the flexibility of Compose Multiplatform.
